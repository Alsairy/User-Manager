- **Default Language**: Arabic (primary language for Saudi users)
- **Secondary Language**: English (for international investors and stakeholders)
- **Language Detection**: Automatic detection based on user browser settings with manual override option
- **Language Persistence**: User's language preference stored in profile and maintained across sessions
- **RTL/LTR Support**: Full support for Right-to-Left (Arabic) and Left-to-Right (English) layouts

### 2. User Interface Elements

#### Navigation & Menus
- All navigation menus, buttons, and labels must be available in both languages
- Language toggle switch prominently displayed in header (flag icons or language names)
- Breadcrumbs and navigation paths translated dynamically
- Tooltips and hover text translated

#### Forms & Input Fields
- All form labels, placeholders, and helper text in both languages
- Error messages and validation feedback translated
- Field names and dropdown options localized
- Date pickers supporting both Hijri and Gregorian calendars with appropriate labels

#### Content Areas
- Page titles, headings, and descriptions
- Dashboard widgets and cards
- Table headers and data labels
- Modal dialogs and confirmation messages
- Success/failure notifications and alerts

### 3. Data Management

#### Database Design
```sql
-- Translatable content table structure example
CREATE TABLE content_translations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type VARCHAR(50),
    entity_id UUID,
    language_code VARCHAR(5),
    field_name VARCHAR(100),
    translated_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Supported languages reference
CREATE TABLE languages (
    code VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY,
    name_english VARCHAR(50),
    name_native VARCHAR(50),
    is_rtl BOOLEAN,
    is_active BOOLEAN
);
```

#### Translation Strategy
- **Static Content**: Stored in language resource files (JSON/YAML)

  "locales": ["ar", "en"],
  "defaultLocale": "ar",
  "localeDetection": true,
  "pages": {
    "*": ["common", "navigation"]
  }
}

// Translation key structure
{
  "ar": {
    "common": {
      "submit": "إرسال",
      "cancel": "إلغاء",
      "save": "حفظ"
    }
  },
  "en": {
    "common": {
      "submit": "Submit",
      "cancel": "Cancel",
      "save": "Save"
    }
  }
}
```

#### API Layer
- Accept `Accept-Language` header in all API requests

#### CSS/Styling Considerations

/* RTL/LTR layout switching */
[dir="rtl"] .container {
    direction: rtl;
    text-align: right;
}

[dir="ltr"] .container {
    direction: ltr;
    text-align: left;
}

/* Font family switching */
:lang(ar) {
    font-family: 'Noto Sans Arabic', sans-serif;
}

}
```
